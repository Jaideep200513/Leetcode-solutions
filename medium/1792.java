1792. Maximum Average Pass Ratio

Approach:
1. Observation:
  Adding an extra student to a class [pass, total] increases its pass ratio.
  The improvement (gain) is:

      Î”  = ((pass + 1) / (total + 1)) - (pass / total)

	  This gain tells us how much benefit we get by adding one extra student to this class.

2. Greedy Choice:
  Always assign the next extra student to the class with the largest gain.
  This ensures we maximize the average pass ratio step by step.

3. Data Structure:
  Use a max heap (priority queue) where each class is stored with its current gain.
    Extract the class with the highest gain.
    Add one student to it (update pass & total).
    Recalculate its new gain and push it back into the heap.

4. Final Calculation:
  After all extra students are assigned, compute the sum of pass ratios of all classes and divide by the number of classes to get the final average.
